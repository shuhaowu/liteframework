To use the libraries, go into the desired folder. Copy the files inside the folder named libraries into your $lib_location.
Copy all other directories into your root directories (reason: some might have javascripts, css.. etc.)

1 extra blank line after ?> or before <?php in the library files could stop stuff like imagepng from working. Beaware.
