liteFramework
=============

liteFramework is a simple PHP framework that allows one to easily program in PHP
with minimum learning curve and maximum efficiency. The framework is broken down
into 3 different sections:

 # Model
 # View
 # Controllers

As of right now, the model is incomplete. The source for that system will be
pushed in the next couple of weeks.

The documentations are not all done yet. I'm still trying to document all of the
functions.

There will be examples soon.
