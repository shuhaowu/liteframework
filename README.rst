liteFramework 0.5.2.0
=====================

liteFramework is a simple PHP framework that allows one to easily program in PHP
with minimum learning curve and maximum efficiency. This version of the 
framework does not support database interactions. In order to access that you
have to code your own system.

If you're using PHP 5.3 and above, please use the latest version of 
liteFramework. This version is severely out of date and will only get features
as demanded or bug fixes.

This framework has been tested only on PHP 5.2

To start, edit the index.php file and follow the tutorial on the wiki.
