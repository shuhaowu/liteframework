liteFramework 
=============

liteFramework is a simple PHP framework that allows one to easily program in PHP
with minimum learning curve and maximum efficiency. This version of the 
framework does not support database interactions. In order to access that you
have to code your own system.

This framework requires PHP 5.3. For PHP 5.2, you need to switch the branch to 
php52_support and download those, or download the versions (in tags) tagged with
v0.5.2.x. The PHP 5.2 framework doesn't have a model component as it's too
difficult to develop for.

Warning: The current master branch is not ready for production yet as I'm still
coding away at the orm part of the framework. However, if you do not need the
ORM, you could use the php52_support branch. An upgrade to the most current
version when it's ready shouldn't cause an issue.

Documentation coming soon.
