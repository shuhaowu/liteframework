liteFramework 
=============

liteFramework is a simple PHP framework that allows one to easily program in PHP
with minimum learning curve and maximum efficiency. This version of the 
framework does not support database interactions. In order to access that you
have to code your own system.

This framework requires PHP 5.3. For PHP 5.2, you need to switch the branch to 
php52_support and download those, or download the versions (in tags) tagged with
v0.5.2.x. The PHP 5.2 framework doesn't have a model component as it's too
difficult to develop for.

Documentation comming soon.
